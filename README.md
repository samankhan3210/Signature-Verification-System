# Signature-Verification-System
This is a writer independent signature verification system based on a deep learning model
that utilizes multiple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), batch normalization, and drop out layers. The model is designed to recognize and
verify signatures without the need for writer specific training.
This file contains the results of the same model on two different datasets. First dataset is obtained from Kaggle, whereas the second is CEDAR dataset.
